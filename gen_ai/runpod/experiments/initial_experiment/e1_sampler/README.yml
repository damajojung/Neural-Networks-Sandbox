used_samplers:
  - euler
  - dpm_adaptive
  - dpmpp_Sde_gpu
  - ddpm
  - ipndm
  - imndm_v
  - ddim
results: 
  - dpmpp_sde_gpu and ddpm do not work at all with this many steps and schedulers
  - all other ondes are mostly the same
  - you can see some differences in the close ups
conclusion:
  - lets perceed with ipndm - looks the best for me
