used_schedulers_with_sampler_ipndm:
  - normal
  - karras
  - exponential
  - sgm_uniform
  - simple
  - ddim_uniform
  - beta
results: 
  - karras and exponential do not work under these conditions
  - normal, sgm_uniform, simple are good and very similar
  - ddim_uniform looks the most realistic to me with lots of details, but it is playful and contains variation
  - beta is the second best to me - very realistic but not a playful as ddim_uniform
conclusion:
  - lets perceed with ddim_uniform & beta
