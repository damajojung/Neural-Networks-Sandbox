# Neural-Networks

Here you can find a collection of experiments regarding neural networks. 

- Within the **Food_Challenge**, you can find the code my team and I conducted during a kaggle challenge where we classified different dishes.

- **PyTorch** was my first approach dealing with pytorch with the tutorials by sentdex.
